# Hilbertcurve
Idea : "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s7h2MHQtxc"
This project generates a Hilbert curve and and visually displays it. The main goal was to use as little maths as possible. 
In the end, I was able to generate a proper curve and use it, as well as other Sorting algorithm, to assing values to a 2D Array. The act of generating a sound of an image worked only partially, as the library I used(Beads) wasnt intended for the amount of overlapping sounds I was producing and this all ended in a Memory overflow.
No future updates expected.
